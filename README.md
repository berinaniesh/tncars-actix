# TNCars Actix

REST backend for TNCars, written using Actix-Web, rewritten from scratch.


## Todo

These are long term todos. The codebase can be improved in many areas, but right now, I want to get to a production ready site fast. For short term todos, look at `todo.md` in the root folder.

- [ ] SwaggerUI for API documentation
- [ ] Better error handling throughout (implement AppError)
- [ ] Better implementation of protected routes
- [ ] Proper returning sql queries
- [ ] Look into protobuf / gRPC.
